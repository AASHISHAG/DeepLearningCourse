Prof. steen:

1. Natural intelligence is capable of one-shot learning, while Deep Learning requires large training datasets
2. The neuron model of the brain's information processing has been contradicted by a large number of more recent studies and is outdated


The first point is straightforward and theoretically interesting and could point the way to other approaches to AI. When mentioning the second point, I'm fully aware that the notion of the perceptron is based on the logic-gate model of neurons, and this is definitely the way to introduce and present machine learning. HIstorically, this is where it comes from. It is interesting to also consider some of the more recent evidence, however, which suggests there is a great deal of computational capacity within a single neuron. In this course, it's sufficient to mention this; for your curiosity, I include some notes and links below that illustrte this research. Again, the ability of single neurons to perform complex tasks, perhaps as complex as person recognition, indicates that the neuron in fact contains far more internal structure than the perceptron model suggests, and could again provide a door to new forms of AI.
