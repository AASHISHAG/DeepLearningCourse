### Machine Learning

Learn from the data.

### Deep Learning

**Deep learning** (also known as **deep structured learning** or **hierarchical learning**) is part of a broader family of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#cite_note-BENGIO2012-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#cite_note-SCHIDHUB-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#cite_note-NatureBengio-3)
