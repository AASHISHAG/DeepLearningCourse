It's on dark nights and you have zero visibility to see where you are headed. The only thing you have is a torch to see a short distance. So, what approach will you take to reach the lake? Take a few minutes to think about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the torch to look around the ground beneath your feet. Then you can figure out where it is going downward and take small steps in that direction. In this way, you keep following the path that is descending, step by step, youâ€™re likely to reach the lake at the valley."
